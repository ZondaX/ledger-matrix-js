This package provides a basic client library to communicate with the Matrix AI App running in a Ledger Nano S/X device

There are two running modes:

- *HID*: Direct access via HID. This can be used from a backend, node.js, etc.
- *U2F*: This allows access to the device from the browser (client side)

# Testing

```
yarn install
```
